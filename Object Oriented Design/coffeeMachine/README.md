- Whipped cream


## **Types of coffee** 
<ul>
<li><b>Americano</b></li>
	<ul><li>1 (ground coffee beans) + 2 hot water</li></ul>
	With a similar flavor to black coffee, the americano consists of an espresso shot diluted in hot water. Pro tip: if you’re making your own, pour the espresso first, then add the hot water.   
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<li><b>Black</b></li>
	<ul><li>2 unit (ground coffee beans) + 1 unit hot water</li></ul>
	Black coffee is simply coffee that is normally brewed without the addition of additives such as sugar, milk, cream or added flavours.  
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<li><b>Cappuccino</b></li>
	<ul><li>1 (ground coffee beans) + 1 hot water + 2 steamed milk + 2 whipped cream + 1 sprinkling of chocolate powder</li></ul>
	Cappuccino is a latte made with more foam than steamed milk, often with a sprinkle of cocoa powder or cinnamon on top. Sometimes you can find variations that use cream instead of milk or ones that throw in flavor shot, as well.  
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<li><b>Cafe Latte</b></li>
	<ul><li>1 (ground coffee beans) + 1 hot water + 4 steamed milk + 1 whipped cream</li></ul>
	As the most popular coffee drink out there, the latte is comprised of a shot of espresso and steamed milk with just a touch of foam. It can be ordered plain or with a flavor shot of anything from vanilla to pumpkin spice. (Here’s how to make a copycat Starbucks pumpkin spice latte.)  
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<li><b>Mocha</b></li>
	<ul><li>1 (ground coffee beans) + 1 hot water + 1 steamed milk + 2 whipped cream + 1 chocolate powder</li></ul>
	Like a caffè latte, caffè mocha is based on espresso and hot milk but with added chocolate flavouring and sweetener, typically in the form of cocoa powder and sugar.
